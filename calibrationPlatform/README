Simple script that communicates with an arduino in order to move a stepper to a given position.

It takes the following arguments
d <height in mm> "height is referenced to the local pose of the stepper, hence d -1 will always move the stepper down by 1 mm"
f <.txt with 1 height instruction per line> 
h <help>
calibrate
light <light intensity on DIAS led>


In order to calibrate run the "calibrate" command and let the stepper run until it slips then press the switch in order to stop the calibration.
After calibration the local z height is 0.00 mm and the global z height (from the top of the base to the top of the horizontal platform) is 35.22mm. This was measured manually,
the calculated height using CAD software is 35.70 mm

Note that the script can be run from a non RPi computer if the variable rasPi is set to False. 

Images are saved with the current global height as part of the name in the local directory.

HOW TO USE
1. git clone the project.
2. run "python3 calibrationHost.py" if this is not on a RPi with a camera set the rasPi variable to False
3. enter the desired commands.
